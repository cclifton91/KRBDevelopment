KRB's expertise in upgrading corporate spaces, dental offices, creative environments, and full-floor tenant improvements demanded a modern, professional, and highly functional platform that reflected their work.\n\n### The Project Vision\n\nKRB Development focuses on transforming spaces for businesses, particularly in high-traffic areas such as franchises, corporate offices, and dental practices. The website we created needed to reflect their meticulous attention to detail and high-quality craftsmanship. To achieve this, we envisioned a clean, intuitive design with a strong visual identity that could communicate their brand ethos effectively.\n\n### Crafting the Logo: Affinity Designer\n\nWe started by designing a logo that represents KRB's professionalism and clean aesthetic. Using Affinity Designer, we created a sleek, minimalist logo that embodies strength and precision—qualities that are synonymous with their work. This logo set the tone for the rest of the site, providing a strong visual foundation that would guide the design process.\n\n### Designing the Website: Figma\n\nWith the logo in place, we moved on to designing the website in Figma. Figma's collaborative design capabilities allowed us to work closely with the client to ensure every aspect of the site met their expectations. The design needed to be simple yet elegant, with clear navigation, strong visual hierarchy, and well-organized content that highlights KRB's key services.\n\nWe also made sure the design catered to both desktop and mobile users, ensuring a responsive experience across devices. The final design incorporated visual elements that spoke to KRB's brand identity while keeping user experience at the forefront.\n\n### Developing with Astro: A Static Site Solution\n\nOnce the design was finalized, we chose Astro as the static site generator for development. Astro's approach to shipping minimal JavaScript and focusing on performance made it the perfect choice for a website that needed to be fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly. By keeping the website static, we were able to optimize load times and provide a smooth browsing experience for users, regardless of their internet connection speed.\n\n#### Styling with Tailwind CSS\n\nTo style the website, we used Tailwind CSS. Tailwind's utility-first framework allowed us to quickly implement the custom designs from Figma, maintaining consistency throughout the site. Tailwind made it easy to stay organized while creating responsive layouts and ensuring that each element looked sharp across all screen sizes.\n\n#### Managing Contnent with Decap CMS\n\nFor content management, we integrated Decap CMS, allowing KRB Development to easily update the website's content without needing a developer. The CMS empowers the client to manage project updates, team bios, and blog posts seamlessly, all through an intuitive interface.\n\n#### Hosting with Netlify\n\nFinally, we hosted the website on Netlify. Its deployment process was straightforward, and the platform provided continuous deployment from our Git repository. Additionally, Netlify's built-in features like form handling and CDN integration ensured the site was always fast and secure.\n\nThis project was an exciting opportunity to showcase how modern web technologies can come together to build a high-performing website. KRB Development now has a website that not only looks professional but also serves as a powerful tool for attracting and engaging potential clients in the competitive contracting industry.","src/data/bids/ISUcampus.md",[21],"../../media/bids/ISU_Quad.jpg","e71fc04d0df4aac9",{"html":24,"metadata":25},"\u003Ch2 id=\"building-the-krb-development-website-a-journey-in-crafting-a-seamless-digitial-experience\">Building the KRB Development Website: A Journey in Crafting a Seamless Digitial Experience\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>When KRB Development, a leading general contractor specializing in interior tenant improvements, approached us to create their online presence, we knew it needed to be more than just a website.
