  "aboutText": "My name is Ken Brown. I am a real estate developer with a passion for helping under resourced communities. Growing up on the South Side of Chicago, I saw the lack of good quality housing while observing the negative impacts of red lining. It sparked a desire in me on how to create a positive impact with affordable housing options to help enhance communities' quality of life, no matter the social and/or economic background of individuals in these communities.As someone with 30-years' experience in the real-estate and financing industry, my goal is to utilize these experiences by eliminating the challenges individuals face getting funding for their business. KRB Development is here to make sure that equity and Equitable Stability is a part/available for/ of every community.",
